# user-service-front

This project is a simple front-end providing everything you need to handle authentication with JWT. I did it so I can use it as a seed to start any new project using JWT, feel free to do the same !

It implements authentication middleware, guarded routes, cookie token storage to save the session, and axios interceptors to automatically refresh an expired token.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
